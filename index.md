## **_UseR! 2021 - One Stop Solution_**
  Google normalizes the maximum value of your search query to 100 but when you compare your search query to another topic, your query may go lower volume and expand time scale, the query is may go quite lower. 
  So, instead of looking at the search volume as Google Trends do, transform them to search score. There are object which you looking for and control keywords that should mirror standard usage of internet in a given location. You also can analyze internationalization of  given topic, subject or person.
  
      
 If you want to download, compute, visualize, storage as a SQLLite file and export from Google Trends, here is the `"globaltrends"` package: [Click](https://github.com/ha-pu/globaltrends)

  **_Futures Price Prediction Using the Order Book Data_**  :  
 The purpose of this analysis, to be focused on the order book itself and what if anything one can imply forwards in time based on it.
 After the raw data manipulation and discretizing the data into 1 second; it seems that the model is significant but when looking at the fitted values, the model isn’t giving significant enough forecasts of price.
Adding 2 more explanatory variables to the model for trying to get more explanatory power doesn't make the model any better a predictor than it was before.
